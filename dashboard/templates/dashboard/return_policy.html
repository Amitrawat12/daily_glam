            <h5 class="card-title">Our Commitment</h5>
            <p>Your satisfaction is our top priority. If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase, we are here to help. This policy outlines the conditions under which you can return or exchange a product purchased through our platform.</p>

            <h5 class="card-title mt-4">General Conditions</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Returns are accepted within <strong>30 days</strong> of the delivery date.</li>
                <li>To be eligible for a return, the item must be unused, in the same condition that you received it, and in its original packaging.</li>
                <li>A valid proof of purchase (e.g., order confirmation email or invoice) is required for all returns.</li>
                <li>Please note that as a price comparison platform, the final return process will be handled by the retailer from which the product was purchased (e.g., Amazon, Nykaa). We will facilitate the initiation of the return request.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5 class="card-title mt-4">How to Initiate a Return</h5>

                <li>We will forward your request to the respective retailer and you will receive a confirmation email with further steps.</li>
            </ol>

            <h5 class="card-title mt-4">Refunds</h5>
            <p>Once the retailer receives and inspects the returned item, they will process your refund. The refund will be credited to your original method of payment within 5-7 business days, depending on the retailer's policy.</p>
